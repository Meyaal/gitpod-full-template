# Design

## Colour Scheme
The three main colours used are Teal, MintCream and white.


## Typography

The Lato and oswald fonts is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 

#### I used fontawsome from Javascript to have some fonts, I writed a link in the html files at the bottom of the fiels. 

# Imagery
 Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It conveys a fresh and pleasant environment.

# Langueges uses
#### HTML5
#### CSS3


# Testing 

I tested that this page is working on different browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 

I confirmed that this project is responsive on some different screens sizes. It looks good and functions on standard screen sizes using devtools devise toolbar. 

I have confirmed that the form works requires entries in every field will only accept an email in the field. My submit button didn't work at the moment. This is something that I'll want to fix.


The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. I'll leave a screenshot in case the link doesn't work.

## Unfixed Bugs

My Submit buttom is not clickble despite several tries to make it work. I did google serch and tried to change the code but didn't mange it. 

The code might not really be full responsive on a smaller phones screens. The whole image is not seen but only the top part.
