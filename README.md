## Lighthouse Testing

inline-style:
![alt text](doc/images/screenshoot%20lighthouse.png)

The rate of the performance is 80%, the message I can read is about network load becouse of the size of image. The SEO value is 89% and the message I can read is about meta "Document does not have a meta description". 

I am aware about that values are poor and need to improves. 

I have been i contact with student Turtor to get some assistance with that. The advice that I have got was as long as code is passed validation it should be fine for the project.

I tried to fix by reading the messages showed on lighthouse about the rates. I tried to minimize my CSS file by removing white spaces, but it didn't help to change the rate. I changed size for input-container, the fieldset and the size of logo to minimize the load of network, but it didn't help at all.
